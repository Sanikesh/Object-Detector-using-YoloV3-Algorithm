# Object-Detector-using-YoloV3-Algorithm
The model is made by using YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once V-3) which is a real-time object detection algorithm that identifies specific objects in videos, live feeds, or images. OpenCV is used as a medium for reading and showing the images and videos. YOLO uses features learned by a deep convolutional neural network to detect an object. The given datasets are predefined datasets called CoCo data and Pascal VOC. 


Note:The weights are larger in size so couldn't fit in the repository
